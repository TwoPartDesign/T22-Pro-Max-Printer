These are the Factory settings and recommended setup steps for the printer. I don't recommened using these as there have been updates to slicing software since these were written. The Ender 3 Max or S1 seems to work alright if you have the correct retration and printer size updates.

I've also provided the schematics that were supplied by support for Pin-out diagrams and BOM if anyone is interested in utilizng a different firmware or updating hardware.
