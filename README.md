T22 Pro Max+ Documentation

Provided are all of the files I've found to be available for the (discontinued) T22 Pro Max+ Printer.

In my experience leveling\tramming the X axis is nearly impossible for whatever reason but I have had luck removing the strain gauges from the base plate of the printer, drilling out the holes in the base plate, and adding leveling knobs for manual adjustment and\or the addition of an ABL sensor.
